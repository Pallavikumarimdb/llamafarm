# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables
systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly
programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through trial and error

## Applications

Machine learning has many real-world applications including:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection

## Key Algorithms

### Linear Regression
Used for predicting continuous values based on input features.

### Decision Trees
Tree-like models that make decisions based on feature values.

### Neural Networks
Inspired by biological neural networks, these are powerful for complex patterns.
